Theoretical Assignment

Question-1) What are the different data types present in javascript?
Answer =  In JavaScript, there are several data types that fall into two main categories: Primitive and Non-Primitive.

          1) Primitive Data Types:
String: Represents a sequence of characters used to store text.
Number: Represents numeric values, both integer and floating-point.
Boolean: Represents logical values, either 'true' or 'false'.
Undefined: Indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
Symbol: Represents a unique identifier, often used to create unique property keys for objects.
BigInt: Allows representation of integers with arbitrary precision, useful for working with large 'numbers' that exceed the Number type's limits.

          2) Non-Primitive data type
Object: A complex data type that allows storing collections of data, typically as key-value 
        pairs.
Array: A special type of object used to store ordered collections of values.
Function: A reusable block of code designed to perform a particular task.
Date: An object type that represents dates and times.
RegExp: An object for matching text with a pattern.

Question-2) What are the JavaScript Engines?
Answer =  avaScript engines are specialized programs or interpreters that execute JavaScript code. These engines convert JavaScript code into machine code that a computer's processor can execute. Each browser or environment has its own JavaScript engine, often optimized for that specific platform.

~ Key JavaScript Engines:
1) V8:
i) Developed by Google, V8 is one of the most popular JavaScript engines. It is used in Google Chrome and Node.js.
ii) V8 compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code, making it extremely fast and efficient.

2) SpiderMonkey:
i) Developed by Mozilla, SpiderMonkey is the first-ever JavaScript engine. It is used in the Firefox browser.
ii) SpiderMonkey includes features like Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, garbage collection, and more.

3) JavaScriptCore (Nitro):
i) Developed by Apple, JavaScriptCore, also known as Nitro, is used in Safari and other WebKit-based browsers.
ii) JavaScriptCore emphasizes performance and efficiency, with optimizations like JIT compilation.

4) Chakra:
i) Developed by Microsoft, Chakra is used in the Internet Explorer and Edge (Legacy) browsers.
ii) Chakra also includes JIT compilation and has been known for its performance improvements over time.

5) ChakraCore:
An open-source version of Microsoft's Chakra engine, used in various applications beyond the browser.

6) Hermes:
Developed by Facebook, Hermes is optimized for running JavaScript in mobile environments, particularly for React Native.

Question-3) Explain ECMA in JS.
Answer = ECMA in JavaScript refers to the ECMAScript standard, which is the specification that JavaScript is based on. ECMAScript is a scripting language specification created by ECMA International, a standards organization. The term "ECMAScript" is often used interchangeably with JavaScript, though ECMAScript is technically the standard, while JavaScript is its most well-known implementation.

JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript, meaning it follows the rules and features defined in the ECMAScript specification.
Other implementations of ECMAScript include JScript (by Microsoft) and ActionScript (used in Adobe Flash).

Versions of ECMAScript:
1-Over time, new versions of ECMAScript have been released, each adding new features and improvements to JavaScript.
2-For example, ES6 (released in 2015) added many new features like 'let', 'const', and arrow functions, which made writing JavaScript easier and more powerful.

ECMAScript ensures that JavaScript works the same way in all browsers and environments. This way, code written in JavaScript can be understood and run anywhere, making web development consistent and reliable.

Question-4)  Why We use JavaScript?
Answer = We use JavaScript because it makes websites interactive and dynamic.
Here are some points-
1) Interactivity: JavaScript allows you to add things like buttons that respond when clicked, forms that can be filled out, and animations that make the website more engaging.
2) Real-Time Updates: It can update content on the page without needing to reload the entire page, like showing new comments or live scores.
3) Web Applications: JavaScript is essential for building complex web applications like online games, social media sites, or shopping carts.
4) Cross-Platform: It works on all web browsers and devices, so the same code can be used on phones, tablets, and computers.
5) Wide Support: Almost every website uses JavaScript, so itâ€™s a must-learn language for web developers.

Question-5) What is JavaScript? And also Explain the histroy of JavaScript?
Answer = JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. It enables you to create features like interactive forms, animations, and real-time updates on websites. JavaScript runs in web browsers, allowing developers to build complex web applications without requiring users to install additional software.

History of JavaScript:
Creation (1995):
Developer: JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape Communications.
Original Name: It was initially called Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript.
Purpose: JavaScript was designed to enable dynamic content on web pages and complement Java, which was a popular language for server-side development at the time.

First Release (1996):
Version: The first version, known as ECMAScript 1 (ES1), was introduced in December 1996.
Standardization: JavaScript was standardized by ECMA International, which published the ECMAScript standard to formalize the language's syntax and features.

Evolution and Key Versions:
ECMAScript 3 (1999): Introduced features like regular expressions, try/catch for error handling, and better string handling.
ECMAScript 5 (2009): Brought significant improvements, including strict mode, JSON support, and new methods for arrays and objects.
ECMAScript 6 (2015): Also known as ES6 or ECMAScript 2015, this was a major update introducing features like classes, modules, arrow functions, let and const, template literals, and promises.
Subsequent Versions: ECMAScript has continued to evolve, with new versions released annually, introducing features such as async/await, new array methods, and enhancements to improve performance and developer experience.

Modern Era:
Frameworks and Libraries: The rise of frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js has further expanded JavaScript's capabilities and use cases.
Server-Side and Beyond: JavaScript is now widely used on the server-side with Node.js, and it supports a wide range of applications beyond traditional web pages, including mobile apps and desktop applications.
